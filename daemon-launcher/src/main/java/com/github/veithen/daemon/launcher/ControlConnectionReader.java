/**
 * Reads messages from the control connection. The main purpose of this is to detect as soon as
 * possible when the control connection is closed by the parent process and to terminate the child
 * process if that is unexpected. To achieve this we need to read the messages eagerly and place
 * them into a queue. In particular this covers the case where the child process has received a
 * <tt>STOP</tt> message and {@link Daemon#stop()} or {@link Daemon#destroy()} hangs. In this case,
 * if the parent process is terminated (or stops waiting for the <tt>STOPPED</tt> message and closes
 * the control connection), we can stop the child process immediately.
